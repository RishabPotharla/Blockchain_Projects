## ‚ú® Features

- **Receipt Metadata Builder**: Build JSON metadata for receipts including:
  - Merchant ID  
  - Purchase timestamp (with timezone)  
  - Basket totals & line items  
  - Warranty details (auto-calculated)  
  - Product serial / IMEI (hashed only, never stored in plain text)

- **Privacy**: Sensitive info (serial/IMEI) is SHA-256 hashed before inclusion.  
- **IPFS Upload via Pinata**: Metadata is always pinned to IPFS with your Pinata account.  
- **NFT Minting**: Mint your receipts as ERC-721 NFTs directly on Sepolia.  
- **Transferable**: After minting, NFTs can be sent to any other wallet via MetaMask‚Äôs NFT tab.

VITE_BRAND_IMAGE_URI=ipfs://bafkreid4pytrh5ruilxemenbmykzm2mscjubyisvsey2ffhj7cuuelix34

# Pinata JWT (required for uploading metadata to IPFS)
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Generate this from Pinata ‚Üí API Keys ‚Üí Create JWT
# ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT commit your real JWT to GitHub
VITE_PINATA_JWT=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...<your token here>

## üì¶ Notes
- Requires MetaMask (or another EVM wallet) connected to Sepolia.  
- Always use `ipfs://<cid>` for on-chain `tokenURI`. Gateways (e.g., `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<cid>`) are fine for previews but not stored on-chain.  
- After minting, NFTs are fully transferable from MetaMask ‚Üí NFT tab ‚Üí Select token ‚Üí Send.  
- **Never commit your real Pinata JWT**. Use environment variables locally or in deployment.
